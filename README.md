# Project-2---Particle

# Milestone 1

I've always been an admirer of animation and 3D designs, and I'm attracted to websites with intriguing and engaging interactivity. I believe it is a great approach to keep people interested while also creatively presenting what the website requires or wants the users to achieve and understand. 

I initially used javascript(p5js) to make generative art, patterns, and visualizations last year while taking Justin's Creative Coding course. This course motivated me to explore the realm of creative coding and construct aesthetically beautiful, dynamic, and living website designs. 

During that course, I discovered Three JS and briefly read about it, but I never had the opportunity to go more into it and explore it. To create an interactive landing page, I want to learn and explore the various JS libraries, notably THREE.js, for my Project 2 assignment. I've been reading about the numerous JS libraries and how each of them has very unique characteristics but could potentially be combined to make a very dynamic website. 

### DESIGN IDEA 
Initially, I was considering building upon my Project 1 by generating a 3D model of the product (an ordinary skincare bottle) and enhancing the interactivity of my existing product detail page with a 3D model using THREE.js. 

However, I wanted to develop an entirely new aesthetic and design for this project in order to provide myself with a challenge and to depart from my regular visual approach. 

I want to develop the primary design using THREE.js, but I may also investigate PIXI.js to provide a complementary interactive backdrop if possible. 

Spline.design is a website that enables you to build 3D models in the same manner as Blender or Maya. If feasible, I would also want to learn this new technology to construct my 3D model. 



### PROJECT 2 Design 
For this project, I want to utilize the Particle system in THREE.js, construct a 3D object in Spline, then import it into my code so that it can rotate, zoom, and perhaps be deformed using the mouse. The scene will also have text. 



### PROTOTYPE 
As of now, I have a general concept of how my prototype's design would appear, but this may change as I begin coding and learn more about THREE.js and WEBGL. 

To develop my prototype, I made a hand-drawn drawing on an iPad. Drawing my ideas on paper first assists me to get my creative juices flowing and gives me with a clear outline of what I am attempting to create and what I want to accomplish. 





In conclusion, I look forward to learning this new JS tool and becoming more imaginative in order to construct an interactive website that maintains the user's interest. This project has the potential to be the kind of work I want to be able to undertake as a Front End Developer and is a solid foundation for me to develop upon.






# Milestone 2

I've been reading the documentation and watching YouTube tutorials to figure out how THREE JS works. It is a large library to learn from, and it might be frightening since there is so much you can do and so many different methods to accomplish it. 

The particle system in Three js is what piqued my interest. I noticed a few tutorials where the object or 3D structure displayed by the particle system could be altered using three js and mouse controls. 


I was inspired by a website, snp.agency, I saw online while looking for inpiration. Their landing page features a cool interactive 3d model that sits behind some text and moves when you hover over it with your mouse.


### Design & Prototype
I was thinking of portfolio pieces so that I can add this to my portfolio hence, I want to yet again work on making a cool ecommerce website. Nike is such an amazing brand and their aesthetics are very intriguing to me. They are abstract and always have some sort of interactivity within their websites.

Thus for my design I was thinking of creating a landing page for a Nike shoe. The Nike Shoe would be the 3d model I will be designing in spline(still learning this tool). 
The shoe on the landing page would be made into a particle system using a three js particle system and it would move as you hover over it or zoom in and out. If possible I may add some light effects to it as well to make it pop more.

There will be a button that will take you then into that product(the shoe) detail page. Here that same 3D model of the show would be in color and solids instead of the particles.

Below is a sketch of the pages I wish to build.
